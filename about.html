        <p>I am a master's student at the Rochester Institute of Technology who is working as a Web Developer at Rochester Regional Health.

            I love applying all kinds of responsive designs and watch web pages developed by me shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing.
            
            I believe that success demands a healthy work ethic. Simple things like being on time, meeting targets and deadlines, and working to the best of one’s ability are ultimately what differentiates a successful project from an unsuccessful one. My determination and persistence to work hard and keep moving forward in the face of obstacles have led to success – both in academics and at work. My eagerness and willingness to learn is evidenced by the fact that I honestly admit mistakes.</p>

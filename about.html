          <p>
            I am currently pursuing my master's in the field of Information
            Science and Technology at Rochester Institute of Technology. I also
            work as a software developer at my university where I am responsible
            for making a web app for a client based in the UK. I was on a co-op
            with Rochester Regional Health as a full stack developer. I also got
            an opportunity to lead a team of developers and designers. <br />I
            love applying all kinds of responsive designs and watch web pages
            developed by me shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. I
            believe that success demands a healthy work ethic. Simple things
            like being on time, meeting targets and deadlines, and working to
            the best of one’s ability are ultimately what differentiates a
            successful project from an unsuccessful one. My determination and
            persistence to work hard and keep moving forward in the face of
            obstacles have led to success – both in academics and at work. My
            eagerness and willingness to learn is evidenced by the fact that I
            honestly admit mistakes.
